- **Health Checks:** Monitors the health of backend servers to route traffic only to healthy instances.

## 🛠️ Why Use HAProxy in Docker?

- **Efficient Resource Utilization:** Distributes traffic evenly across multiple Docker containers, optimizing resource usage.
- **Scalability:** Easily scale your application by adding or removing container instances.
- **Simplified Management:** Centralizes traffic management, making it easier to maintain and monitor your applications.
