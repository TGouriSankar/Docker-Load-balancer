### Caddy as a reverse proxy and load balancer in a similar way to how we set up Nginx. Caddy has several advantages, including automatic HTTPS configuration and a simpler configuration syntax.
---
 - Step 1: Create a Directory for Caddy Configuration

        Create a directory for your Caddy configuration:
        mkdir caddy-load-balancer
        cd caddy-load-balancer
---
- Step 2: Create a Caddyfile

    Create a Caddyfile in the caddy-load-balancer directory. This file will define your load balancing rules. Hereâ€™s an example configuration:
    check the Caddyfile code in the caddy-load-balancer directory
---
- Step 3: Create a Docker Compose File

    Create a docker-compose.yml file in the same directory to define your application services and Caddy:
    check the docker-compose.yml code in the caddy-load-balancer directory
---
- Step 4: Start the Services

    In the caddy-load-balancer directory, run:
  
            docker-compose up -d
---
- Step 5: Access Your Application

    Open your web browser and navigate to:
>    http://localhost \

 Caddy will route your requests through its reverse proxy, balancing the load between app1 and app2.

---
-    Step 6: Testing the Load Balancer

  As with the Nginx setup, you can refresh the page multiple times to see the load being balanced. Caddy will automatically handle the round-robin distribution of requests.

---
- Step 7: Stopping the Services

    To stop and remove the services, use:

        docker-compose down
---
Using Caddy as a reverse proxy and load balancer is a straightforward process, and it offers some conveniences like automatic HTTPS without needing extra configuration.
